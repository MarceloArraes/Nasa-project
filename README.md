# Nasa-project
Reactjs+Expressjs

Project made along side a course about nodejs on UDEMY.

A node project with a front end build-in (first time i used the npm run build!) deployed into the cyclic ecosystem.
That deployment gave me some bumps on the road but overall it was worth it.

The project is still laking a real DB, that will be implemented further down the line (i hope so!)
